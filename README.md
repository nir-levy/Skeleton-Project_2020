# IoT Course
Exercises and example code for the IoT course

## [Mobile App](https://github.com/AlexPshul/iot-course/tree/master/01%20Mobile%20App)
In this exercise, we are going to create a basic counter app, which will increase a counter on the screen each time the user presses a button.

## [IoT Device](https://github.com/AlexPshul/iot-course/tree/master/02%20IoT%20Device)
In this exercise, we are going to learn about IoT Hub, the device SDK and how to send data from the device to the cloud when the device user is pressing a button.

## [Serverless and DB](https://github.com/AlexPshul/iot-course/tree/master/03%20Serverless%20and%20DB)
In this exercise, we are going to learn about Azure Functions, SignalR service, Event Hub, IoT Hub custom routing and Azure Storage Table. This will allow us to connect our device to our mobile app and save the data between sessions.

## [WebApp](https://github.com/AlexPshul/iot-course/tree/master/04%20Web%20App)
In this exercise, we are going to create a web app, connect it to our IoT Hub and send messages from it to specific devices, which in turn will increase the counter.
